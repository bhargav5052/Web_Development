            <h2>UG-Btech in Computer Science</h2>
            <p> Introduction to computer programming for solving a variety of problems.<br> 
                This course is intended for non-computer science and non-computer engineering majors.<br>
                Emphasis on the fundamentals of design, development, testing, implementation,<br>
                and documentation of computer programs. Includes problem solving with structured<br>
                techniques and algorithms using pseudo code and/or graphical representations.<br>
                This course may use instructional examples and assignments from various<br>
                programming languages, including but not limited to C, Objective-C, C++, C##,Java.

            <h2>UG-Btech in Electrical</h2>
            <p>An introduction to electrical and computer engineering, systems engineering design,<br>
                 programming, microcontrollers, soldering and circuit building. Students will work<br>
                individually and on teams to complete projects and create a system for an end of <br>
                term competition. Students will also learn about technical documentation<br>
                and communication. Topics include functions, arrays, conditionals, loops,<br>
                Boolean algebra, wireless communication, resistors, transistors.

            <h2>UG-Btech in Mechanical</h2>
            <p> This course describes in designing airplanes, helicopters, and space vehicles.<br>
                Mechanical engineers design robots in every industry we work in. They make robots for<br> 
                surgery, cleaning, manufacturing, and space exploration. Some of them wind up doing<br>
                things that donâ€™t look like engineering but still require compassion, teamwork,<br>
                creativity, and curiosity; Also scientists, clergy, social workers, managers, <br>
                teachers, and physicians. Mechanical engineering is a broad field so<br>
                mechanical engineering graduates can find fulfilling work in any industry.
